## Repository Snapshot  
Full‑stack codebase (Next.js + Django REST, PostgreSQL, Docker‑Compose) for the **evalXAI** challenge platform.  
My focus: developer onboarding material, file‑upload UX, admin tooling, and cloud‑hosting research.

## Notes & Reflections

- Early **documentation** paid off: newcomers now onboard in ~30 min.  
- I evaluated several hosting avenues—Azure, AWS, and a self-hosted Docker setup—mapping out costs, student-credit programs, security features, and scalability trade-offs so the team has a well-structured reference for making a future hosting decision.
