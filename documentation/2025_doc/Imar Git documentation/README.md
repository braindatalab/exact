# Git Documentation

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the frontend and backend implementation of the **evalXAI platform**.  
It allows users to submit explainability challenges, upload datasets, and evaluate models using scoring metrics such as **EMD** and **IMA**.  

## My Work on the Project:

### Week 1–2 (16.04 – 27.04)
- Joined the project and group communication tools (e.g., WhatsApp)
- Cloned the repository and set up the local development environment (Docker, Django, PostgreSQL, npm)

### Week 3 (28.04 – 04.05)
- Analyzed project structure
- Tested dummy challenges
- small Improvments to frontend display (e.g. better date formatting)

### Week 4 (05.05 – 11.05)
- Modified challenge creation view to display the actual username instead of "unknown"
- Worked on fixing the scoring logic

### Week 5 (12.05 – 18.05)
- Learned Django DB commands: `makemigrations`, `migrate`
- Started implementing a delete button for challenge entries

### Week 6 (19.05 – 25.05)
- Added “Company Name” field on the login page (with Elman and Yves)
- Continued working on challenge deletion logic

### Week 7 (26.05 – 01.06)
- Successfully saved “Company Name” to the database
- Fully implemented and tested the delete functionality

### Week 8 (02.06 – 08.06)
- Reflected on frontend UX and suggested improvements for first-time users

### Week 9 (09.06 – 15.06)
- I was ill – no contributions this week

### Week 10 (16.06 – 22.06)
- Caught up with the team and discussed milestones

### Week 11 (23.06 – 29.06)
- Finalized the display of usernames on challenge submissions (with Elman)

### Week 12 (30.06 – 06.07)
- Waited on merge conflict resolution
- Identified a security issue with file uploads (blocked file insertions)

### Week 13 (07.07 – 13.07)
- Tested all milestone implementations
- Supported the final presentation preparation


## Notes
- The original codebase was unstructured, which made it difficult for me to find my way around in the beginning.
- I initially struggled to understand the system due to its complexity and missing guidance.
- To improve the overall usability, I focused on making the platform more user-friendly by:
  - Suggesting UX improvements
  - Clarifying unclear UI flows
  - Improving documentation

## Final Thoughts

This internship gave me hands-on experience in **full-stack development**, GitHub collaboration, and the real-world challenges of building infrastructure for explainable AI.  
I contributed through frontend development, issue testing, user-focused features, and constant feedback on the user experience.
